   ZANZOUKEN SECTION:

Here is how to use Zanzouken: After you do the command, Raditz will enter a "pre-zanzoken" state. He will stay like that for 1,10 seconds, wich he will stay unveruneable for 1 second. When you do the command, you can "direct" Raditz to where he will go pressing:

 FORWARD - he will go forward
 BACKWARD - he will go backward
 UP - He will go up and behind the enemy

If you don't press anything, after the time is over, he will return to the stand motion.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
  ADDING THE ENDING: 
It's simple, just go into the DATA folder, open System.def in any text editor, search for [Win Screen] and replace the code with this one:

[Win Screen]
wintext.text = 
wintext.font = 2,0,0
wintext.offset = 159,70
wintext.displaytime = -1
wintext.layerno = 2
fadein.time = 32
pose.time = 10000
fadeout.time = 64
