As Bandai doesn't take shame in the face and it doesn't place the trunks with sword  
in any game then decided to do that char that is one of my favorite ones  
after the rock, that version is complete with many blows and supers of   
everybody of the original games and other facts for me, I hope have a good time  
as me playing with him. It was worth the whole ones that waited for the modernizations   
without claiming that I really leaves me very happy reason I make that for  
that everybody has a character that guarantees a lot of amusement.

If you have less than 18 years it doesn't play with that char, piece to an adult   
that it plays with you, that char possesses Moves that exhibit it carries to an extreme   
violence and murderous tendencies. Or don't play with him in front of   
its brother, he can be impressed.  
  
PS: I am not responsible for any influence that that char can cause   
to people that adore to imitate everything, don't leave for oh killing the other ones. :P
