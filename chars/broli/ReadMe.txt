If you have tried out Kuzu-bei's version of Broli, you'll probably know 
approximately how this one will be like. This is an update to his character,
and since Kuzu-bei has given me his permission to do so, I'd thought I'd 
make a number of changes, so that Broli will be closer to the movie, rather 
than the original game.

Biography:

Race: Saiyajin
Eyes: Black
Hair: Black
Abilities: Bio Ekisyushyu Kyodai Ka, Bukujutsu, Ki Barrier, SSJ, USSJ, Zanzoken

The original Super Saiyajin, Brolli exhibits tremendous power, even as an infant. When Planet 
Vegeta is destroyed by Furiza, it is this power that keep him and his father alive. Before his home 
planet's destruction, he is traumatized by the constant crying of his crib mate, Goku, and develops 
an instinctual hatred of him.Years later, Brolli begins his rampage on the universe under his father's 
command. In order to divert suspicion, Brolli's father actually employs the help of Vegeta and the 
rest of the Z warriors to find the cause of all this chaos. Brolli's grudge against Goku reveals the plot 
however, and after the battle Brolli is thought to be destroyed. However, his hatred is strong enough 
to allow Brolli to come to Planet Earth in movie #10, where he is finally killed. He makes a THIRD 
appearance when he is cloned in movie #11, and is transformed into a large gelataenous green blob. 

---------------------
Broli's Features:
---------------------

Custom AI:

-There are 3 difficulties of play against Broli: Easy, Normal, Hard. Change the "Pallette Order" to adjust:

Pallettes 7 and 8 - Easy
Pallettes 9 and 10 - Normal
Pallettes 11 and 12 - Hard

By default, the difficulty is Hard.

4 Counter Attack Systems:

1.) Air Counter: Used the same way as a recovery move. In USSJ Mode, can be done anytime while being hit.
2.) Block Counter: Used to push yourself forward when blocking, or to defend yourself, and gain power. (hold back) You are then free to attack the opponent.
3.) Hit Counter: Used when you are in a hit state. Execute any special move will counter the opponent. Can only be done while in USSJ Mode.
4.) Instantaneous Movement Recover: An alternate move to "Recovery", this can be used during getting hit states. (similar to Super Gokou)

3 Modes of play:

1.) Flying: A new type of flying, Broli will not fall when damaged, and has the ability to block non projectile attacks.
2.) USSJ Mode: Broli's strength is increased by 1.2 times. 
3.) Fury Mode: This is automatically triggered when Broli's life is at 500. He gains "Super Armor" (eg Hulk from Marvel VS Capcom)
